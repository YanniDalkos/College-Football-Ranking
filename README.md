# College-Football-Ranking
This R script is separated into two parts in which the first pulls data from over fifty different web pages and organizes the data into a usable data frame.  The data is organized to meet a specific format at which point I apply a college football ranking method developed by Dr. Wesley Colley from Princeton University, which employs what is called a Colley matrix to produce unbiased Division I-A college football rankings.  The Colley matrix ranking method is unique in that it adjusts for strength of schedule without bias toward conference, tradition or region (Colley).  This project is an example of how to take a research method in this case a college football ranking method and implement it in practice and generate results.
